# APRStoSQL
###### Current Release 07032024

Welcome to the Wiki.

APRStoSQL is a python script designed to stream APRS data into an SQL Server database.

The Script will connect to the APRS-IS backbone, filter the data coming in and stream it to a SQL Server database for any other uses. 

There is no processing on the data other then parsing it from the APRS-IS data stream.

This script can be run either as a standalone application or in Docker.

This software is intended for use by Amateur Radio Operators only.
